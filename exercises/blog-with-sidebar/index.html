                    Initial D (Japanese: 頭文字イニシャル D, 
                    Hepburn: Inisharu Dī) is a Japanese 
                    street racing manga series written and 
                    illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno. It was 
                    serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga 
                    magazine Weekly Young Magazine from 
                    1995 to 2013, with the chapters 
                    collected into 48 tankōbon volumes. 
                    The story focuses on the world of 
                    illegal Japanese street racing, 
                    where all the action is 
                    concentrated in the mountain 
                    passes and rarely in cities or 
                    urban areas, and with the drifting 
                    racing style emphasized in particular.

                    Avex has released the anime in several 
                    parts called Stages. A recurrent 
                    feature of the anime is its extensive 
                    usage of Eurobeat as background music 
                    in race scenes, especially by Italian 
                    singers.
