            <b>Graphic design</b> is a profession,
            <sup>[2]</sup> academic discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and 
            applied art whose activity consists in projecting 
            visual communications intended to transmit 
            specific messages to social groups, with specific 
            objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of design<sup>[1]</sup> and of 
            the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, 
            innovation and lateral thinking using manual or 
            digital tools, where it is usual to use text and 
            graphics to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the 
            communication process is that of encoder or 
            interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of 
            visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses 
            the aesthetics of typography and the compositional 
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery
            to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond 
            what language alone expresses. The design work can 
            be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends
            up being established linguistically, either orally 
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design 
            transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
            manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any visual 
            communication system. For example, it can be 
            applied in advertising strategies, or it can also 
            be applied in the aviation world<sup>[8]</sup> or space 
            exploration.<sup[9][10]</sup> In this sense, in some 
            countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches and 
            drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
            communication is a small part of a huge range of 
            types and classes where it can be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
            <sup>[11]</sup>graphic design as applied art was 
            initially linked to the boom of rise of printing in
            Europe in the 15th century and the growth of 
            consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution.
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in 
            the West, closely associated with advertising in 
            the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its evolution 
            allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. 
            Given the rapid and massive growth in information 
            exchange today, the demand for experienced 
            designers is greater than ever, particularly 
            because of the development of new technologies and 
            the need to pay attention to human factors beyond 
            the competence of the engineers who develop them.

        <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with 
            first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 
            article,<sup>[14]</sup> although it appears in a 4 July 1908 
            issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a 
            publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, 
            in an article about technical education for 
            printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence 
            which prevails among printers is an assurance that 
            with the elemental principles of design at their 
            finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and
            develop into specialists in graphic design and 
            decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the
            California School of Arts & Crafts advertised a 
            course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which 
            replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. 
            Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.
            <sup>[16]</sup>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively 
            recent explosion of visual communication in the 
            20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between 
            advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has 
            disappeared. They share many elements, theories, 
            principles, practices, languages and sometimes the 
            same benefactor or client. In advertising, the 
            ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to 
            give order to information, form to ideas, 
            expression, and feeling to artifacts that document 
            the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession 
            is relatively recent concerning its preparation, 
            activity, and objectives. Although there is no 
            consensus on an exact date when graphic design 
            emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. 
            Others understand that it began to be identified as 
            such by the late 19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>

        <h5>Historical Background</h5>
        <p>
            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood 
            blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to 
            reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture 
            printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. 
            Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer 
            scrolls and books were produced using movable type 
            printing, making books widely available during the 
            Song dynasty (960–1279).<sup>[19]</sup>
        </p>
        <h5>Nineteenth Century</h5>
        <p>
            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces 
            in design education in Great Britain, informing the 
            government of the importance of design in his 
            Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized 
            the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern 
            industrial technology and Victorian design.
        </p>
        <h5>Twentieth Century</h5>
        <p>
            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and 
            instructor at the California School of Arts and 
            Crafts, taught a class entitled "Graphic Design 
            and Lettering".<sup>[26]</sup> Raffe's Graphic 
            Design, published in 1927, was the first book to 
            use "Graphic Design" in its title.<sup>[27]</sup> 
            In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend 
            published his book titled "Graphic Design" and 
            it is known to be the first piece of literature 
            to cover the topic extensively.<sup>[28]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry grew in 
            parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns 
            and criticisms, notably from within the graphic 
            design community with the First Things First 
            manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, 
            it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 
            manifesto in 1999 in the magazine Emigre 51
            <sup>[34]</sup> stating "We propose a reversal of 
            priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and 
            democratic forms of communication – a mindshift 
            away from product marketing and toward the 
            exploration and production of a new kind of 
            meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it 
            must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; 
            it must be challenged by other perspectives 
            expressed, in part, through the visual languages 
            and resources of design."<sup>[35]</sup>

        <h2 id="applications"> Applications</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, 
            from road signs to technical schematics and 
            reference manuals. It is often used in branding 
            products and elements of company identity such as 
            logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.
        </p>
        <p>
            From scientific journals to news reporting, the 
            presentation of opinion and facts is often improved
             with graphics and thoughtful compositions of 
             visual information – known as information design. 
             With the advent of the web, information designers 
             with experience in interactive tools are 
             increasingly used to illustrate the background to 
             news stories. Information design can include Data 
             and information visualization, which involves 
             using programs to interpret and form data into a 
             visually compelling presentation, and can be tied 
             in with information graphics.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative 
            presentation of existing text, ornament, and 
            images.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "process school" is concerned with 
            communication; it highlights the channels and 
            media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode 
            these messages. The semiotic school treats a
            message as a construction of signs which through 
            interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.[citation needed]
        </p>
        <h5>Typography</h5>
        <p>
            Typography includes type design, modifying type 
            glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs 
            (characters) are created and modified using 
            illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the 
            selection of typefaces, point size, tracking 
            (the space between all characters used), kerning 
            (the space between two specific characters) and 
            leading (line spacing).
        </p>
        <h5>Page Layout</h5>
        <p>
            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements 
            (content) on a page, such as image placement, text 
            layout and style. Page design has always been a 
            consideration in printed material and more recently
            extended to displays such as web pages. Elements 
            typically consist of type (text), images 
            (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally 
            place-holder graphics such as a dieline for 
            elements that are not printed with ink such as 
            die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind 
            embossing.
        </p>
        <h5>Grids</h5>
        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space 
            and information, allowing the reader to easily 
            comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a 
            grid functions as a container for information and 
            a means of establishing and maintaining order. 
            Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many 
            graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. 
            The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a 
            highly systematic approach to visualizing 
            information. However, grids were later regarded as 
            tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of 
            "designersaur." Today, grids are once again 
            considered crucial tools for professionals, 
            whether they are novices or veterans.
