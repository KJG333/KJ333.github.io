        <h3>Back to the Future</h3>
            <p>
                In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill 
                Valley, California, with his depressed 
                alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older 
                siblings, who are professional and social 
                failures; and his meek father, George, who 
                is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. 
                After Marty's band fails a music audition, 
                he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer 
                Parker, that he fears becoming like his 
                parents despite his ambitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, Marty meets his eccentric 
                scientist friend, Emmett "Doc" Brown, in 
                the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils 
                a time machine built from a modified 
                DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled 
                from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a 
                destination time of November 5, 1955 (the 
                day he first conceived his time travel 
                invention), the terrorists arrive 
                unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees 
                in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating 
                time travel when he reaches 88 miles per 
                hour (142 kilometers per hour).

            <h3>Jaws</h3>
            <p>
                In the New England beach town of Amity Island, 
                a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim 
                during a beach party. An unseen force attacks 
                and pulls her underwater. Her remains are found 
                washed up on the beach the next morning. After 
                the medical examiner concludes it was a shark 
                attack, newly hired police chief Martin Brody 
                closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn 
                persuades him to reconsider, fearing the 
                town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, 
                apparently under pressure, now concurs with the 
                mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. 
                Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until 
                a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded 
                beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an 
                amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric 
                and roughened local shark hunter, offers his services 
                for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper 
                examines the girl's remains, confirming that an 
                abnormally large shark killed her.

            <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
            <p>
                Industrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, 
                a theme park of cloned dinosaurs, on the tropical 
                island Isla Nublar, located off of the coast of Costa 
                Rica. After a Velociraptor kills a dinosaur handler, 
                the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald 
                Gennaro, demand a safety certification. Gennaro 
                invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and Hammond invites 
                paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie 
                Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a 
                live Brachiosaurus and other dinosaurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the 
                cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from 
                prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs, 
                among other animals, was used to fill in gaps in the 
                dinosaurs' genome. To prevent breeding, the dinosaurs were 
                made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group 
                witnesses the hatching of a baby Velociraptor and visits 
                the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the 
                ethics of cloning and the park's creation. Malcolm warns 
                of the implications of genetic engineering and scoffs at 
                the park's design, saying it will inevitably break down.
